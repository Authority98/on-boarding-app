## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Migration: 20250829000001_add_dashboard_fields_to_clients.sql
ALTER TABLE public.clients ADD COLUMN view_mode VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'dashboard';
ALTER TABLE public.clients ADD COLUMN dashboard_slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE;
```

### API Extensions
- Extended `clientOperations.getBySlug()` for public dashboard access
- Updated `clientOperations.create()` to handle new fields
- Added slug generation with collision handling

### Component Architecture
```
ClientDashboard (Router)
├── DashboardMode (Full analytics experience)
├── TaskMode (Simple task list)
└── HybridMode (Dashboard + Task sidebar)
```

### Security Considerations
- Public dashboard access doesn't require authentication
- Client data is filtered by slug for security
- Row Level Security policies maintained for agency access
- No sensitive agency data exposed in client dashboards

## Development Server

The system is running on: `http://localhost:3001`

### Test URLs:
- Agency Dashboard: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard/clients`
- Example Client Dashboard: `http://localhost:3001/client-dashboard/[client-slug]`

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Real-time Data Integration**: Connect to actual analytics APIs
2. **Custom Branding**: Allow agencies to customize client dashboard themes
3. **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations for tasks
4. **Notification System**: Real-time updates for clients
5. **Custom Fields**: Allow agencies to add custom dashboard sections
6. **Analytics Tracking**: Track client engagement with dashboards

## Migration Required

To use this system, apply the database migration:
```bash
# Apply the migration in Supabase
# File: supabase/migrations/20250829000001_add_dashboard_fields_to_clients.sql
```

## Responsive Design

All dashboard modes are fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Full layout with all features
- **Tablet**: Adapted layouts with collapsible elements
- **Mobile**: Optimized for touch interaction with stacked layouts

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready client dashboard editor system that allows agencies to create personalized experiences for their clients.
