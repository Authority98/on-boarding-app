## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm
- Supabase account
- Stripe account (for payments)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Authority98/on-boarding-app.git
cd on-boarding-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your Supabase and Stripe credentials to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

4. **Set up Stripe CLI for webhook testing (REQUIRED for subscription functionality):**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Forward webhooks to your local server (CRITICAL for payment processing)
export STRIPE_API_KEY=$(grep STRIPE_SECRET_KEY .env.local | cut -d '=' -f2)
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook

# Copy the webhook signing secret from the CLI output and add it to .env.local
# Without this, subscription updates will not work properly!
```

**Important**: The Stripe CLI must be running during development for subscription updates to work. If you complete a payment but don't see your plan updated, check that the Stripe CLI is forwarding webhooks.

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

### Subscription Status Issues

If you complete a payment but your plan doesn't update:

1. **Check Stripe CLI**: Ensure Stripe CLI is running and forwarding webhooks:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook
   ```

2. **Manual Sync**: Run the manual subscription sync script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/sync-missing-subscription.js
   ```

3. **Verify Webhook Secret**: Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` matches the CLI output

4. **Check Console Logs**: Look for debug logs like:
   ```
   üîç Plan Detection Debug: {...}
   üîç Subscription details: {...}
   ```

### Development Setup

- **Port**: Development server automatically uses port 3001 if 3000 is busy
- **Environment**: All environment variables must be properly configured
- **Database**: Ensure Supabase migrations are applied
- **Payments**: Test payments require Stripe CLI for webhook handling
