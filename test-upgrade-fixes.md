## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Saved Card Upgrade Flow
**Steps to Test:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Upgrade Plans
2. Click upgrade on Startup or Agency plan
3. Select existing saved payment method
4. Complete upgrade

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ User remains logged in throughout process
- ✅ Success popup shows after redirect to dashboard
- ✅ Current plan button updates to show "Current Plan"
- ✅ Console shows debug logs tracking subscription updates

### Scenario 2: New Card Upgrade Flow
**Steps to Test:**

2. Click upgrade on Startup or Agency plan
3. Choose "Add New Payment Method"
4. Complete Stripe Checkout with new card

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ User remains logged in throughout process
- ✅ Success popup shows after redirect to dashboard
- ✅ Current plan button updates to show "Current Plan"
- ✅ Console shows debug logs tracking subscription updates

## 🔍 Debug Console Logs

When testing, you should see logs like:
- `🔍 Plan Detection Debug:` - Shows subscription state during plan detection
- `🔄 PricingPlans: Refreshing subscription data` - Shows subscription refresh triggers
- `🔄 StripePopup: Refreshing subscription after successful saved card upgrade`
- `🌐 NETLIFY` or `🏠 LOCALHOST` prefixes for environment-specific debugging

1. **Test actual payment flows** (requires test Stripe keys)
2. **Verify subscription data updates** in real browser environment
3. **Test cross-browser compatibility**
4. **Verify mobile responsiveness** of upgrade flows
5. **Test error handling** for failed payments
